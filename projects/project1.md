# The fluvial biogeomorphic impacts and feedbacks of riparian invasive non-native plant species

Establishment and spread of invasive non-native plant species (INNPs) continues to accelerate globally, despite significant management efforts. Riparian corridors, transitional zones between terrestrial and freshwater systems, are biodiversity hotspots but also highly vulnerable to INNP invasion. INNPs are linked to a wide range of negative impacts, including biodiversity loss and influencing geomorphic processes, but the impacts of INNPs on fluvial geomorphic process remain understudied.

My PhD thesis explored how invasive plants species like Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) impacted riverbank stability, erosion and sediment dynamics. Using a combined approach of field data, piecewise structural equation and landscape evolution modeling to reveal the fluvial biogeomorphic impacts of plant invasions; with a focus on *Impatiens glandulifera* (Himalayan balsam).



Funded by: an internal Newcastle University Studentship


## Key Findings

- First evidence synthesis on INNPs and their influence on riverbank erosion finding a bi-directional effect
- ***I. glandulifera* augments seasonal reduction in riverbank stability** over winter   
- ***I. glandulifera* increases rates of riverbank erosion** but also identified a **previously unknown negative dead-stem overwinter erosion feedback**.  
- **Seed dispersal modelling** provided first estimates of potential *I. glandulifera* dispersal distances.  
- At the reach scale, ***I. glandulifera* may increase sediment yield and topographic change**.
