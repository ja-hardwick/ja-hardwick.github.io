# *Impatiens glandluifera* (Himalayan Balsam): roots in the riparian zone

Funded by: The British Society for Geomorphology PGR grant (BSG-2024-19)

Plant roots play a crucial role in nutrient competition by anchoring in place and enables access to soil resources. Root systems can form complex networks can give a competitive advantaged over other plants for soil resources. Additionally, roots can help stabilise riverbanks by increasing sediment cohesion by redistributing exerted forces and modulating sub-surface water movement. However, what happens to the root systems of riverbanks under non-native plant invasions - in this project we use the invasive non-native Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan Balsam) as model organism to quantify differences in rooting traits between invaded and un-invaded riverbanks. We use non-destructive in-situ minirhizotron methodology to measure root traits through time and link this to geotechnical and vegetation surveys.  

This project wouldn't be possible with out the amazing fieldwork and intial data analysis work undertaken by Stirling Undergraduate Abbie Cato as part of their 3rd year dissertation!
