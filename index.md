# About:
I am an Earth scientist whose research explores how ecological processes
shape and interact with Earth surface landforms, particularly in fluvial
environments. I use a combination of field data and modelling approaches
to quantify the feedbacks between plant communities and geomorphic
processes. A key focus of my research is understanding how invasive plant species
influence fluvial processes. I also work on the interactions between
sociological–ecological systems and sedimentology, with current research
investigating how near-future land-use change may mediate sediment loss
in Tanzania, to support climate resilience and sustainable landscape
management. Additionally, I conduct research on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in
environmental sciences fieldwork, focusing on how higher education
institution policies can support—or fail to protect—marginalised
fieldworkers.
